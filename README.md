# FLUTTER CHAT_APP
A guided project to learn user authentication, and push notifications. Following udemy course [Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/) by Maximillian SchwarzmÃ¼ller.
The original project source code can be found [here](https://github.com/academind/flutter-complete-guide-course-resources/tree/main/Code%20Snapshots/14%20Chat%20App).

**Disclaimer**:
 - This project was for learning purposes.
 - And this is not a replica of Maximillian's actuall project, which you can find <a href = 'https://github.com/academind/flutter-complete-guide-course-resources/tree/main/Code%20Snapshots/14%20Chat%20App'>here</a>
  - I have made some changes to the UI and the code structure.

Chat App is a basic chat application built using Flutter and Firebase for various backend features. This app allows users to send and receive messages in real-time, authenticate users, store user data, and send push notifications. Whether you want to explore how real-time messaging and user authentication work in Flutter or build your chat application, this project serves as a great starting point.

# Features

- **Authentication**: Users can create accounts or log in using their email and password. Firebase Authentication is used for user authentication.
    ```dart
    // Authentication with Firebase
    await _auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword(email: _email, password: _password);
    ```
- **Real-time Messaging**: Chat messages are sent and received in real-time using Firebase Cloud Firestore. Messages are ordered by creation time and displayed in a chat interface.
    ```dart
    // Send message to Firestore
    await _firestore.collection('chat').add({
        'text': message,
        'createdAt': Timestamp.now(),
        'userId': user.uid,
        'username': user.displayName,
        'userImage': user.photoURL,
    });
    ```
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload profile images during account creation, and these images are stored in Firebase Storage.
    ```dart
    // Upload image to Firebase Storage
    final userRefInFbSt = FirebaseStorage.instance
        .ref()
        .child('user_images')
        .child('${userCredential.user!.uid}.jpg');
    await userRefInFbSt.putFile(_pickedImageFile!);
    ```
- **Push Notifications**: The app supports push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). Users are subscribed to the 'chat' topic for notifications.
    ```dart
    // Subscribing to the 'chat' topic for push notifications
    final fcm = FirebaseMessaging.instance;
    await fcm.requestPermission();
    fcm.subscribeToTopic('chat');
    ```
